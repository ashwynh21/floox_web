<p class="topic">
    Automating the hard parts about Trading
</p>
<div class="start">
    Hi, let us tell you bit by bit, the story that has brought <strong>Floox</strong>
    to where it is now. It is crazy when we think back on how loosely the idea began,
    yet here we are, a fully integrated platform where traders can commune üòÅ.
</div>

<div class="about">
    <div>
        <p>Where <strong>Floox</strong> began üßê</p>
        <div>
            <p>"Everything begins with an idea."</p>
            <p> - Earl Nightingale - </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            So all our founders are from Eswatini by the way, and we have all known each other
            from one place or the other. We met in Ezulwini for trading lessons and that is
            where we had a casual discussion into realizing one of us was a programmer and so the
            query came up about developing indicators for MT4/5 e.t.c.

            We got really creative with our thoughts and quite simply decided to start a project
            on it, and here we are.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>What does <strong>Floox</strong> do? ü§∑</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Floox</strong> is a trading service platform that offers many different ways
            to automate your trading using MT4/5. It's really quite easy to link many of your trading
            accounts with <strong>Floox</strong>, <strong>Floox</strong> actually allows you a great
            set of ways to manage and optimize your strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Floox</strong> is built to understand to frustration of not being able to follow
            a strategy and allows you to implement a way to use it diligently by letting you link
            it with our automation system.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Get in touch with us üëã</p>
        <p>
            So there's quite a few of us on the <strong>Floox</strong> team, and we are each
            responsible for different functions in <strong>Floox</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The <strong>Floox</strong> road map</p>
        <p>
            With all the work that we have planned for <strong>Floox</strong> we pretty much have our hands
            tied for the next year or so. The general idea or approach we are discussing is creating <strong>Floox</strong>
            to be better at integrating with our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you want to keep up with the features our developer team is working on you should check out the

        <p>
            We all have our preffered areas to lurk on, but as <strong>Floox</strong> you can catch mostly on

            moment we might not have the man power to naturally catch us on any other social media platform.
